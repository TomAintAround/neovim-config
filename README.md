# Neovim configuration

This is my personal configuration for Neovim. I 100% recommend actually knowing how to setup a configuration yourself and use mine as a reference ([here's a great tutorial serires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQn2hJeHQbM&list=PLep05UYkc6wTyBe7kPjQFWVXTlhKeQejM)). But if you're crazy, just run the following command:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/TomAintAround/neovim-config ~/.config/nvim
```

## Prerequisites

1. Install the following programs: make, ripgrep

## Recommendations

1. Again for the love of every superior entity make sure you know what you are doing. This won't directly destroy your computer, but it will be mentally painful for you if you don't even know what Vim is.

2. Run the following command inside of Neovim to see if you're missing something: `:checkhealth`
